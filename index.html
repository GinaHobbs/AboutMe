        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Gina Hobbs. I am currently 33 years old. I live in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma with my sister, a dog and a cat.</p>
        <p>I have a Bachelor of Science in Chinese Mandarin, with an emphasis in Computer Science. I also have an A.S in Physics, Science and Math. I am currently enrolled in Code Fellows to obtain a Full Stack Sofware Engineer certificate.</p>
        <p>In the past I have worked in the Navy as a linguist, as an IT Helpdesk Technician, as a Librarian and as a Site Reliability Engineer.</p>
        <p>I am currently committed to graduating from Code Fellows and also to obtaining my Network+ and Security+ certificates. I also want to learn to play guitar better and finally master fingerpicking, maybe even learn a song or two.</p>
